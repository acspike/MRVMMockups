            <p>At one time or another most people find themselves in situations that seem overwhelming.  It can be the result of an emergency, illness, lay-off from work, being the victim of a crime or abuse, release from jail or prison, the struggle to stay sober, or other situations.</p>
            <p>The resulting needs can  vary — employment, help with managing money, encouragement, getting connected with available services, transportation, finding a place to live,  help with rent, managing a household, making meals, clothes, finding a sense of belonging and more.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p>At the same time there is also the need to deal with guilt and get closer to God.  Many  are looking for inner peace and meaning in life.</p>
            <p>Minnesota River Valley Mentoring Program helps people who are looking for assistance in the above and are willing to be in a mentoring program.</p>

            <p>We commit to provide the guidance and help that people need as well as a consistent and welcoming church home and a community that will lift them up instead of bring them down.</p>

            <h4 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Todd</h4>
            <p>Todd was recently  released from a long stay in jail.  He had lost his job and had no money. He had no family to provide emotional or financial help.  His support was basically that of his probation officer  While that support was important, it wasn’t sufficient to help him settle in a healthy lifestyle and to lead a productive life.</p>
            <p>Working with a probation officer, Minnesota River Valley Mentoring Program helped Todd get the necessary personal items he initially needed, connect  with local county services,  fill out job applications, prepare for interviews, and get a job through a local employment office.</p>
            <p>Mentors encouraged Todd. They prayed for and with Todd.  To the extent that Todd felt comfortable, they also helped Todd to know more about God and his love for people in Jesus.</p>
            <p>While Todd still struggles with issues, he is working with his mentors.  Yet he is not alone in his struggles.  He knows God is with him; his mentors are there too.</p>

            congregation. Though pleasant people,
            Mike and Beth struggle in getting to worship, paying bills, and in raising their children.  Neither Mike nor Beth came  from solid families with good role models.</p>
            <p>After being introduced to our mentoring program, they committed to  it as well as program guidelines.</p>
            <p>One mentor is helping them with money management. Their  church is helping Mike and Beth with limited financial assistance. A couple is helping Mike and Beth with parenting and when needed, are sitting with the family to assist them during worship.</p>
            <p>God is working.  Mike and Beth are working.  The mentors are working. By God’s grace things are working out.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Each week individuals walk into our New Ulm churches looking for help.  The ministry staffs do their best to identify their real needs, give them the Gospel, and if possible, determine if we or others can help with immediate physical needs and more importantly, their spiritual needs. </p>
            <p>The people vary. There are low-income persons or fixed-income persons who recently have met with a crisis. </p>
            <p>There are persons recently released from jail or prison who are trying to make a new start but need help walking that path.</p>
            <p>There are persons new to life in New Ulm and trying  but struggling make it here. </p>
            
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The needs are unique to the individual – gas, lodging, encouragement, clothing, help with rent, a consistent and welcoming church home, a sense of belonging and community that will lift them up instead of bring them down, and the list continues.</p>
            <p>Our churches, in conjunction with Brad Price of  the WELS Prison Ministry, are developing the Minnesota River Valley Mentoring Program to train and empower our ministerial staffs and church members to meet the spiritual needs of these persons as well as to help them with their physical needs.</p>
